# What is Chrony Style?
Chrony style is the Daily Utah Chronicle's writing style guide. It generally follows AP style guidelines, with some variation and additional rules, namely: "When referring to the University of Utah, first use the entire name, then 'the U' on all subsequent references." This rule as well as formatting for dates (we follow AP to a T here) are what this program checks for.

# How it Works
The GUI has two text boxes, one to check for the "University of Utah" rule mentioned in the above section, the other to convert dates to Chrony/AP style. With the first box, simply paste any text and hit the "Check" button to check for accuracies and errors with the rule. Accuracies and errors will be highlighted in green and red, respectively. With the second box,
type a date in mm/dd/yyyy format, hit the "Convert" button and the text box will show the converted date.
